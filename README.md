## ReactJS & Spring Data REST
* `@Entity` is a JPA annotation that denotes the whole class for storage in a relational table.
* `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` are JPA annotations to note the primary key and that is generated automatically when needed.
* `@Data` is a Project Lombok annotation that auto-generates getters, setters, constructors, to String, hash, equals and other things. It's essentially cutting down the boilerplate code.
